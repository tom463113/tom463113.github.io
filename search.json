We have a common interest in flying FPV drones and aircraft models, so we quickly get started. But soon, the senior co-founder was transfered to other school, lefting me and only a few other members.\nThis is the draft of our club planning initially created by the senior schoolmate⬇️\n\n"},{"title":"About me","url":"/project/2024/12/27/About-me1/","content":"Welcome to my website ～(∠・ω&lt; )～\n\n\n\n\nHello, welcome to my website! I would briefly introduce me to you in this page. My name is Tom and I am currently a grade 12 student at Tsinglan School located in Dongguan, which is not a well-known city between Shenzhen and Guangzhou.  I was born in Hong Kong and went to school there until 8th grade, then I started my journey in my current school. My Chinese name was super complicated in traditional Chinese,  but after coming to the mainland, simplified Chinese names are much easier to write.\nI put many efforts to do this website, so hope you can learn more about me here.\n"}]

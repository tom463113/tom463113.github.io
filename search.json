[{"title":"About me","url":"/2024/12/27/About-me1/","content":"Welcome to my website ～(∠・ω&lt; )～\n\n\n\n\nHello, welcome to my website! I would briefly introduce me to you in this page. My name is Tom and I am currently a grade 12 student at Tsinglan School located in Dongguan, which is not a well-known city between Shenzhen and Guangzhou.  I was born in Hong Kong and went to school there until 8th grade, then I started my journey in my current school. My Chinese name was super complicated in traditional Chinese,  but after coming to the mainland, simplified Chinese names are much easier to write.\nI put many efforts to do this website, so hope you can learn more about me here.\n"},{"title":"AIC Club","url":"/2024/12/26/AIC_Club/","content":"\n The sky is unlimited\n\n\nTake off\n\nThe Aircraft Investigation Club(ACI) was founded on September 14, 2021, when I was grade 9, by me and a senior student. We have a common interest in flying FPV drones and aircraft models, so we quickly get started. Initially, there were 5 people in our club.\nBut soon, the senior co-founder was transfered to other school. \nThis was the draft of our club planning created by the senior schoolmate⬇️\n\n\nBuilding the first droneFor a while, there was little activity in our club after our beloved senior transfered. I realized that if this continued, we might become just another inactive group, like many other “paper clubs” in my school.\nI began building my first drone partly because a friend gave me three drone motors after he broke one of the four. The second reason was that I accidentally met a very good friend who also played FPV around that time. After that, I purchased all the necessary components online and started assembling them.\n\n\nIt was the second time I use the soldering iron, so the welding spots was awful.\n\n\n\nfiguring out the wiring\n\nAfter a tons of bugs and troubles, the drone could lift off finally without burning any electronic components or chips. \n\n\nvery cool right? It only cost me 500rmb (≈71usd)\n\n\n\nstrange landing position\n\n\n","categories":["Activities"]},{"title":"RCC_Club","url":"/2024/12/25/RCC-Club1/","content":""}]

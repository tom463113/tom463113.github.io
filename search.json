[{"title":"AIC Club","url":"/2024/12/26/AIC_Club/","content":"\n The sky is unlimited\n\n\nTake off\n\nThe Aircraft Investigation Club(ACI) was founded on September 14, 2021, when I was grade 9, by me and a senior student. We have a common interest in flying FPV drones and aircraft models, so we quickly get started. Initially, there were 5 people in our club.\nBut soon, the senior co-founder was transfered to other school. \nThis was the draft of our club planning created by the senior schoolmate⬇️\n\n\nMain character in AIC\nMeCurrent club leader\n\n\nEric CaiHe is a close and cherished friend of mine, both in the club and outside the club. We share an abundance of common interests. He was not a “science major” student like me, he was a music student who would go to music college in Germany, and I am a “semi-professional” clarinet player as well. I knew him before when we were in the orchestra rehearsals(his skills in trumpet were amazing), but our common interest in FPV drones made us closer friends.Unfortunately, he was transferred to a music school in northern China for a more professional trumpet teacher. We miss him very much.\n\n\nDerek Liummmm……\nHe is such a naughty and noisy 10 grade boy. His passion to RC planes and FPV drones was to an extreme, absolutly crazy. I was amaze by his tallent in academic ( his passion of leaning came from aircrafts, no joking), his creativity, and his endless enthusiasm in aviation. In my view, passion is very important to everone’s life, so in this case his passion is a positive overall. I knew that he would never feel depress or super upset (unless his drone crashed), even he does, he will not sink into it, because he always have aircraft in his mind.\nBut, like many other extreme example, he has many flaws too. His sense of value is distorted, maybe because of the excess pocket money gaven by his family. He could get 3000rmb if he read a english book, which is a strong incentive that he could use the money to buy a new plane model or something. Hence, he never value things correctly, since everytings are so cheap to him.\n\n\nBuilding my first droneFor a while, there was little activity in our club after our beloved senior transfered. I realized that if this continued, we might become just another inactive group, like many other “paper clubs” in my school.\nI began building my first drone partly because a friend gave me three drone motors after he broke one of the four. The second reason was that I accidentally met a very good friend who also played FPV around that time. After that, I purchased all the necessary components online and started assembling them.\n\n\nIt was the second time I use the soldering iron, so the welding spots was awful.\n\n\n\nfiguring out the wiring\n\nAfter a tons of bugs and troubles, the drone could lift off finally without burning any electronic components or chips. \n\n\nvery cool right? It only cost me 500rmb (≈71usd)\n\n\n\nstrange landing position\n\n\n2024 Annual Review\n\nThe four core members: Edward, Derek, Eric, Me (from left to right)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe club members in the lift after the club activity.\n\n\n\nvery chill …\n\n\n\nEric in the bamboo bush finding his tiny drone (he completely sank into the bush)\n\n\n\nthe last flight before eric leave. \n\n\nAll in all, our club member all love the club very much, and are all very active thoughout the year 2024. We build strong friend ship and engineering skills additionally. As of today, the AIC has been a success.\n","categories":["Activities"]},{"title":"RCC_Club","url":"/2024/12/25/RCC-Club1/","content":"\nWriting this article at the end of 2024, I felt time passed too fast, and amazed by how long the journey we had. in the four years, we had been though failure, victory, covid-19, losing 20 of the 28 initial members, and gaining 40 new members. We had overcome all of them, and still thrived.\nSearching photos for this website bring back huge amout of past memories. The RCC club accompanied me through my high school life. There are only six months left to graduate. How time flies, I really want to be with this club forever.\n\nBeginningIn 2021, my friend King and I founded the Robotic Competition Club (RCC) because of a shared interest.\nAt first there were only five members made up of our close friends. Then we tried to recruit students from across the school who were interested in robotics competitions.\nFinally, we have 28 members when we registration FRC team number–8857.\nIn order to hire more professional instructors and reduce the cost burden of the robot, we applied for funding from the school. The principle accepted, and sponsor our club 250,000rmb and our activity room A419. \n"},{"title":"About me","url":"/2024/12/27/About-me1/","content":"Welcome to my website ～(∠・ω&lt; )～\n\n\nHello, welcome to my website! I would briefly introduce me to you in this page. My name is Tom and I am currently a grade 12 student at Tsinglan School located in Dongguan, which is not a well-known city between Shenzhen and Guangzhou.  I was born in Hong Kong and went to school there until 8th grade, then I started my journey in my current school. My Chinese name was super complicated in traditional Chinese,  but after coming to the mainland, simplified Chinese names are much easier to write.\nI put many efforts to do this website, so hope you can learn more about me here.\n\nAbout me"}]
